# SVHNDeepLearning Learning to Recognise Multiple Digits in Real-World Images with Convolutional Neural Networks

This project explores how Convolutional Neural Networks can be used to identify series of digits in natural images taken from The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
All the code in this project has been written using Python 2.7 and the Convolutional Neural Networks have been implemented using TensorFlow.
